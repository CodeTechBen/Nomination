1st round:
Deal 10 cards each - dont show others. Try to guess how many tricks you are going to win. - that goes in first column.  Player left from dealer guesses first and goes first.  The number of tricks must not equal the number of cards. So for example you if have 8 cards, because its the 3rd round, the total guesses, of all players, of tricks must not equal 8.  You must follow the lead suit if you can.  Ace is high.  Highest card wins unless trumped. If 2 players trump highest trump wins.  You don't have to trump if trying not to win trumps.  Whoever wins trick lays down for next trick.

If you guess correctly you get 10 point + a point for each trick.  If you guess wrong, you get a point for each trick
